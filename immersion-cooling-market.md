<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Immersion Cooling</li><li>Two-Phase Immersion Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Immersion cooling is a method of cooling electronics by submerging them in a dielectric liquid. Single-phase immersion cooling involves submerging the components in a liquid that remains in a liquid state throughout the cooling process, while two-phase immersion cooling uses a liquid that transitions between liquid and vapor phases to absorb and dissipate heat. Both types offer efficient cooling solutions for high-performance computing systems, data centers, and other electronics where traditional air cooling methods may not be sufficient.</p></p>
