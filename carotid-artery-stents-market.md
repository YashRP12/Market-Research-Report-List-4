<p><strong>The Carotid Artery Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-Expandable Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carotid artery stents are used to treat carotid artery disease, a condition that can lead to stroke. There are two main types of carotid artery stents: Balloon-expandable stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expandable stents are placed in the artery and then inflated to keep it open, while self-expanding stents expand on their own once placed. Both types of stents are used to improve blood flow in the carotid artery and reduce the risk of stroke.</p></p>
