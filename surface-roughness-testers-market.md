<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Roughness Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>By Contract Type</li><li>Contact</li><li>Non-contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface roughness testers can be categorized based on the contract type as contract or non-contract testers. Contract testers involve direct contact with the surface being measured, providing accurate and precise results. Non-contact testers, on the other hand, do not come into direct contact with the surface, making them ideal for delicate or easily damaged surfaces. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific application requirements and the nature of the surface being tested.</p></p>
