<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allogeneic</li><li>Autologous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy market includes two main types: Allogeneic and Autologous. Allogeneic therapy involves using T cells from a healthy donor and modifying them to target cancer cells in the recipient. This approach allows for off-the-shelf treatments, potentially reducing time and cost. Autologous therapy, on the other hand, uses the patient's own T cells, which are extracted, modified, and then infused back into the patient. This personalized approach may result in a more targeted and effective treatment.</p></p>
