<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The cDNA Library Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phage Library</li><li>Plasmid Library</li></ul></p>
<p><p>cDNA libraries are collections of complementary DNA molecules that represent the transcribed genes of an organism. Two common types of cDNA libraries are phage libraries and plasmid libraries. Phage libraries involve inserting cDNA fragments into the genome of a bacteriophage, allowing for the storage and amplification of DNA sequences. Plasmid libraries, on the other hand, involve the use of plasmid vectors to store cDNA fragments. Both types of libraries are essential tools in molecular biology research for studying gene expression and function.</p></p>
