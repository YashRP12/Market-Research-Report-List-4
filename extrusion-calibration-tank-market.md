<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extrusion Calibration Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum</li><li>Non-vacuum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extrusion calibration tanks are used in the manufacturing process of plastic extrusion to rapidly cool and shape the extruded material. There are two main types of extrusion calibration tanks: vacuum and non-vacuum tanks. Vacuum tanks use negative pressure to cool and shape the material, producing a smoother surface finish and improved dimensional accuracy. Non-vacuum tanks rely solely on water or air to cool the material, resulting in a slightly lower level of precision but are generally simpler and more cost-effective. Both types of tanks offer unique benefits depending on the specific needs of the extrusion process.</p></p>
