<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IoT RFID Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive RFID</li><li>Active RFID</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IoT RFID Software market includes two main types: Passive RFID and Active RFID. Passive RFID systems do not have a power source and rely on the reader to provide energy for tags to transmit data. They are typically used for asset tracking and inventory management. Active RFID systems have their own power source and can transmit data over longer distances. They are often used for real-time location tracking and monitoring of high-value assets. Both types play a crucial role in enabling seamless data collection and analysis in IoT applications.</p></p>
