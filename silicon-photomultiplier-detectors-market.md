<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Photomultiplier Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Silicon Photomultiplier</li><li>Digital Silicon Photomultiplier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon photomultiplier detectors are classified into two main types: analog and digital. Analog silicon photomultipliers convert incoming photons into analog signals, which are then amplified for detection. On the other hand, digital silicon photomultipliers convert photons into digital signals, allowing for precise digital counting and discrimination of photons. Both types offer high sensitivity and low noise levels, making them ideal for applications in medical imaging, nuclear physics, and other fields requiring accurate detection of low-light signals.</p></p>
