<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Power Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Type</li><li>Photonic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Terahertz power detectors are devices used to measure the power of terahertz radiation. There are two main types of terahertz power detectors - thermal type and photonic type. Thermal type detectors work by converting the absorbed power into heat, which can be measured using temperature sensors. Photonic type detectors, on the other hand, use photodetectors to convert terahertz radiation into an electrical signal, which can then be measured. Both types of detectors play a crucial role in various applications such as spectroscopy, imaging, and communication systems.</p></p>
