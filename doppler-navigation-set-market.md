<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler Navigation Set Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Wave</li><li>Pulse Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Doppler Navigation Sets are commonly divided into two main types: Continuous Wave (CW) and Pulse Wave (PW) markets. In CW Doppler, a continuous signal is transmitted and received simultaneously, allowing for real-time data collection on moving targets. On the other hand, PW Doppler sends short bursts of ultrasound waves and then listens for echoes, providing more detailed information about the velocity and location of objects. Both CW and PW Doppler systems are used in various applications, including medical imaging, radar systems, and navigation technologies.</p></p>
