<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Gaskets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Formed-In-Place (FIP) Type</li><li>Cured-In-Place (CIP) Type</li><li>Injected-In-Place (IIP) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid gaskets are commonly categorized into three main types based on their application method: Formed-In-Place (FIP) Type, Cured-In-Place (CIP) Type, and Injected-In-Place (IIP) Type. FIP gaskets are applied directly onto the flange surface, while CIP gaskets are pre-cured and then applied to the flange. IIP gaskets are injected into the flange joint and allowed to cure in place. Each type has its own advantages and is selected based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
