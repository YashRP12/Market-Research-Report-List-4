<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Constrained Peptide Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cyclic Peptides</li><li>Disulfide-Rich Peptides (DRPs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Constrained peptide drugs are a type of therapeutic molecule designed to have specific structural constraints that enhance their stability and target binding affinity. The two main types of constrained peptide drugs are cyclic peptides and disulfide-rich peptides (DRPs). Cyclic peptides are molecules in which the peptide backbone forms a closed loop, while DRPs contain multiple disulfide bonds that stabilize their structure. Both types of constrained peptide drugs offer increased resistance to enzymatic degradation and improved pharmacokinetic properties, making them promising candidates for drug development.</p></p>
