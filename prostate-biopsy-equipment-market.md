<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Biopsy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound)</li><li>TPBX (trans-perineal)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prostate biopsy equipment market includes two main types, TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound) and TPBX (trans-perineal). TRUS involves inserting a probe into the rectum to guide the biopsy needle to the prostate, allowing for real-time imaging of the procedure. TPBX, on the other hand, involves inserting the needle through the skin between the scrotum and anus to access the prostate. Both methods have their own set of advantages and limitations, and are commonly used in diagnosing prostate cancer.</p></p>
