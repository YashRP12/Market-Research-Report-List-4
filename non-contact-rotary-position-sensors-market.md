<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Contact Rotary Position Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital Output</li><li>Analog Output</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact rotary position sensors can be categorized into two main types: digital output and analog output. Digital output sensors provide a discrete signal, typically in the form of binary code, indicating the position of the rotary object being measured. On the other hand, analog output sensors offer a continuous signal that varies according to the position of the object. Both types have their own advantages and applications, with digital sensors being more precise and easier to integrate with digital systems, while analog sensors offer smoother and more continuous data output.</p></p>
