<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI)</li><li>BSI Stacked</li><li>Front-illuminated (FI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS image sensor modules come in different types such as backside-illuminated (BSI), BSI stacked, and front-illuminated (FI). BSI sensors are designed to capture more light by flipping the photodiodes to the backside, resulting in improved image quality, especially in low-light conditions. BSI stacked sensors take this a step further by stacking other components on top of the sensor for better performance. Front-illuminated sensors are the traditional type where light enters through the front, although they are generally less efficient in capturing light compared to BSI sensors.</p></p>
