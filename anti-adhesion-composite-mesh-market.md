<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-adhesion Composite Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Mesh</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-adhesion composite mesh is classified into three main types: non-absorbable mesh, absorbable mesh, and others. Non-absorbable mesh is designed for long-term implantation without being broken down by the body, providing strong and durable support. Absorbable mesh gradually degrades and is absorbed by the body over time, making it ideal for temporary reinforcement. Other types of composite mesh may include hybrid materials or specialized coatings to prevent adhesions. Each type offers unique benefits for surgical applications.</p></p>
