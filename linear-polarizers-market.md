<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Polarizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorptive Polarizers</li><li>Beam-splitting Polarizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear polarizers are optical devices that can filter out light waves vibrating in certain orientations, allowing only light waves vibrating in a particular direction to pass through. There are two main types of linear polarizers on the market: absorptive polarizers, which absorb light waves vibrating in unwanted orientations, and beam-splitting polarizers, which split light waves into two orthogonal polarization states. These two types of polarizers are commonly used in various applications, including photography, LCD displays, and scientific research.</p></p>
