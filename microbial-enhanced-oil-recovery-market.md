<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Method</li><li>Reservoir Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) is an innovative technique used to increase oil recovery rates by using microorganisms to manipulate oil properties in reservoirs. There are two main types of MEOR methods: the Ground Method and the Reservoir Method. The Ground Method involves injecting microbes into the ground near the oil reservoir, while the Reservoir Method introduces microbes directly into the reservoir. Both methods aim to improve oil recovery rates by altering the properties of the oil and increasing its flow within the reservoir.</p></p>
