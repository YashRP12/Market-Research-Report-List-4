<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Output Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Minimally Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac output monitoring equipment is categorized into three types based on the level of invasiveness - invasive, minimally invasive, and non-invasive. Invasive methods involve the insertion of a catheter directly into the heart or major blood vessels. Minimally invasive techniques use less invasive methods such as sensors on the skin or veins. Non-invasive methods, on the other hand, do not require any penetration of the skin and instead utilize external devices to monitor cardiac output. Each type offers a range of options for monitoring cardiac function.</p></p>
