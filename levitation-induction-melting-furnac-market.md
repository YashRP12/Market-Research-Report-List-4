<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Levitation Induction Melting Furnac Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coreless Induction Furnace</li><li>Cold Crucible Induction Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Levitation induction melting furnace is a type of advanced melting equipment used in the metallurgy industry to melt and refine materials. There are two main types of levitation induction melting furnaces: coreless induction furnace and cold crucible induction furnace. Coreless induction furnaces use a copper coil surrounding a refractory crucible to generate heat and melt materials. Cold crucible induction furnaces, on the other hand, use a water-cooled copper crucible to prevent contamination and achieve higher purity in the melted materials.</p></p>
