<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electroceutical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-Implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electroceutical devices are divided into two main types: implantable and non-implantable. Implantable electroceuticals are devices that are surgically placed inside the body to deliver electrical stimulation or modulation directly to targeted tissues or nerves. These devices are often used for chronic conditions such as chronic pain, epilepsy, or Parkinson's disease. Non-implantable electroceuticals, on the other hand, are external devices that deliver electrical stimulation through the skin, such as TENS units or transcranial magnetic stimulation devices. These devices are often used for acute pain management or neurological disorders.</p></p>
