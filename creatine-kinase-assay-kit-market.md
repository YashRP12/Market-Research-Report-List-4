<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Creatine Kinase Assay Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enzyme Coupling Method</li><li>Colorimetry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Creatine Kinase Assay Kit market includes two main types: Enzyme Coupling Method and Colorimetry. The Enzyme Coupling Method measures creatine kinase activity by coupling the production or consumption of a substrate to a secondary enzyme reaction. Colorimetry, on the other hand, measures creatine kinase activity by detecting a change in color that occurs when a substrate is converted by the enzyme. Both methods offer accurate and reliable results for researchers studying creatine kinase activity in various biological samples.</p></p>
