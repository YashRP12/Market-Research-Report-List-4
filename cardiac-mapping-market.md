<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Mapping Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Cardiac mapping systems</li><li>Non-contact Cardiac mapping systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac mapping systems are used to identify and locate abnormal heart rhythms. Contact cardiac mapping systems involve direct contact between the mapping catheter and the heart tissue, allowing for precise mapping of electrical activity. Non-contact cardiac mapping systems, on the other hand, do not require direct contact with the heart tissue, utilizing technologies such as electrocardiography to create 3D maps of the heart's electrical activity. Both types of systems play a critical role in diagnosing and treating cardiac arrhythmias.</p></p>
